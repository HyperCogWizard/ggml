# GGML Documentation

Welcome to the GGML tensor library documentation. This directory contains comprehensive documentation for understanding and using GGML.

## Documentation Structure

### Core Documentation

- **[Architecture Documentation](architecture.md)** - Comprehensive overview of GGML's architecture with detailed Mermaid diagrams covering:
  - High-level system architecture
  - Backend system design
  - Computation graph flow
  - Memory management
  - Core components and data structures
  - Performance optimizations

- **[GGUF Format](gguf.md)** - Detailed specification of the GGUF file format for model storage and distribution
